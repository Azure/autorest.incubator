# Test
This directory contains the [Pester](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Pester) tests to run for the module. We use Pester as it is the unofficial standard for PowerShell unit testing. Test stubs for custom cmdlets (created in `${$lib.path.relative($project.testFolder, $project.customFolder)}`) will be generated into this folder when `build-module.ps1` is ran. These test stubs will fail automatically, to indicate that tests should be written for custom cmdlets.
